_Available methods_:

* [ `Free fall` ](https://github.com/Soft-Condensed-Matter/NumericalAnalisys/tree/main/Errors):
   This program computes the velocity in a free fall scenario with friction proportional 
   to the velocity. Results are computed with the analytical result of the Newton law and 
   with the aproximation through the Euler method to respective motion equation
