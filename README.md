# Errors and where to find it  #

Numerical errors
-----------
_Available methods_:

* [ `Free fall` ](https://github.com/Soft-Condensed-Matter/NumericalAnalisys/tree/main/Errors):
   This program computes the velocity in a free fall scenario with friction proportional 
   to the velocity. Results are computed with the analytical result of the Newton law and 
   with the aproximation through the Euler method to respective motion equation

* [ `Relative error` ](https://github.com/Soft-Condensed-Matter/NumericalAnalisys/tree/main/Errors):
   This program computes the relative error at each iteration between the analytical and 
   numerical results of the free fall program. Results are saved for later analysis.


* [ `Stability` ](https://github.com/Soft-Condensed-Matter/NumericalAnalisys/tree/main/Errors):
   This program determines the \pi value through the Basilea problem. The main goal is 
   to illustrate the numerical stability of a code and the errors obtained as a function 
   of variables precision, i.e., single or double precision.
